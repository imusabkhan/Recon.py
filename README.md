# Recon.py
This is my personal multi-threaded reconnaissance script written in Python for bug bounty hunting.

## Usage

### Using recon.py
The `recon.py` script in this repository can be used for performing reconnaissance on a specified scope using the following command:

```bash
python3 recon.py scope.txt
```

**Note:** I personally use this script on my Digital Ocean VPS and have not tested it on my local network.
